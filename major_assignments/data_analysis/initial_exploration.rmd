This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

#reading in homicide data
homicide_data <- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")

##how many cities are represented in the data? What are those cities?
homicide_data %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  count()
##There are fifty cities, from Albuquerque to Washington

##What what are the top 10 cities in total number of homicides?
homicide_data %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(total_murders = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_murders))
## Chicago, Philadephia, Houston, Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Dallas, Memphis, New Orleans are the top 10 in the last decade.

##Loading in population data for cities so we can join the datasets
city_pops <- get_acs(geography = "county",
                     variables = c(population = "B01001_001"))
##This will be more difficult to compile. It is not as straight forward as joining these datasets. Some cities are within counties, some of them are their own counties, some have different names than the counties they are in. Derek â€” any pointers on how to get this together? Is there a way to add a county column to the homicide data?

##The age column is a character, but to find the average age of those killed, it has to be a dbl. For this, I have to first make all "Unknown" entries into N/A so that I can make this change
homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(victim_age = na_if(victim_age, "Unknown"))

## Changing column to numeric

homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))

## Calculating the average age of death in the dataset
average_age_set <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(victim_age > 0) %>%
  summarise(total_age = sum(victim_age)) %>%
  mutate(average_age = total_age/48795)
## The average age of the dead in this dataset is 32.05 years old.

## What different races are represented in this data? What race has the most deaths?
homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(victim_race) %>%
  count() 
## There were 33361 murders of Black people in this dataset, making it the most common. 

## What is the gender break down of this dataset?
homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(victim_sex) %>%
  count()
## There are 40739 males represented in this dataset, opposed to 7209 females. There are 4231 unknown.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
