## Loading in homicide data

homicide_data <- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")

## Before we start, we are going to standardize the dates to make them easier to read
homicide_data <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(date = date(mdy_hms(reported_date)))

## Question 1: Cities where the young get murdered. What cities have the highest rate of killings of people under 21? What cities have the most killings of people under 21? In 2012, the Chicago Reporter reported that more young Americans (under 21) die in Chicago than in any other city. Is this true still? It may have the highest total, but does it have the highest rate, which is more effective to adjust for population?

## The age column is a character, but to work with the age of those killed, it has to be a dbl. For this, we have to first make all "Unknown" entries into N/A so that we can make this change

homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(victim_age = na_if(victim_age, "Unknown"))

## Changing column to numeric

homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))

## To make it easier to count and group the number of killings uder 21, we are going to create a new column and call it "Under_21" and fill it with True and False if the age of the killed is under 21 or not.
homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(under_21 = if_else(victim_age < 21, "True", "False"))

## Change victim age back to numeric

homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))

## Now to find out which cities have the highest total of murders of people under 21. We will group by city and count the number of "True" results in the under_21 category for the cities.
under_21_totals <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(under_21 == "True") %>%
  group_by(city,under_21) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(under_21))
## We find that between 2010 and 2017, there were 1412 killings of people under 21 in Chicago, 575 in Philadelphia, 475 in Baltimore and 434 in Houston. We can conclude that, yes, Chicago is where the highest total of people under 21 get killed. In Chicago, what is the average age of those who get killed under 21?
homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(city == "Chicago", under_21 == "True") %>%
  summarise(total_age = sum(victim_age)) %>%
  summarise(total_age/1412)

## The average age of those killed under 21 in Chicago is 16.75 years old. But, is Chicago where the highest rate of kids under 21 die? To find this out, we first need to add population data for each city. We're going to scrape a webpage that has populations for American cities.

pop_url <- "https://ballotpedia.org/Largest_cities_in_the_United_States_by_population"

city_pop <- pop_url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_table()

city_pop <- city_pop[[2]]

## Writing it as a csv so we can load it back in and skip the first row.

write_csv(city_pop, "data/city_pops.csv")

city_pop <- read_csv("data/city_pops.csv", skip = 1)

## This dataset is a bit messy. We are going to clean it up, giving it correct column names and only grabbing the columns we need.

city_pop <- city_pop %>%
  mutate(population = `Population (2013)`) %>%
  select(City, population) %>%
  separate(City, into = c("City","State"), sep = ", ")

city_pop <- city_pop %>%
  select(City, population)

## This dataframe is missing population numbers for Savannah and Washington. We will input those number manually.

city_pop <- city_pop %>%
  add_row(City = "Savannah", population = 145403) %>%
  add_row(City = "Washington", population = 692683)

## Now we are going to join the population data into the homicide data

homicide_data_cleaned <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  inner_join(city_pop, by=c("city" = "City"))

homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  count()

## Back to calculating the rate of murders of people under 21.

under_21_rate <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(under_21 == "True") %>%
  group_by(city,under_21, population) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(under_21))

under_21_rate <- under_21_rate %>%
  mutate(homicide_rate = (n/population)*100000)

## We find that actually, St. Louis is the city where young people die at the highest rate, with 97 deaths per 100000 people. Baltimore, New Orleans and Birmingham follow, with Chicago at the fifth-highest rate. What is the average age of the people that are killed under the age of 21 in St. Louis? 

homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(city == "St. Louis", under_21 == "True") %>%
  summarise(total_age = sum(victim_age)) %>%
  summarise(total_age/309)

## The average age is 17.39 years old. 

## Question 2: Do higher policing budgets lead to higher arrest rates in cities? Where are those policing budgets the highest?

## First, we are going to scrape information from Vera.org with police budget data.

budget_url <- "https://www.vera.org/publications/what-policing-costs-in-americas-biggest-cities"
  
police_budgets <- budget_url %>%
  httr::GET(config = httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = FALSE)) %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_table()

police_budgets <- budget_url %>%
  httr::GET(config = httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = FALSE)) %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_element("tr")

## Derek, when I run this code I keep getting either a list of 0 when I run html_table or html_element. I tried to turn the page into a PDF and get it through Tabula but no cigar. What am I doing wrong here? If I can get this table loaded in, the plan is to join it with the homicide data and calculate the arrest rate in cities where the police budget is the highest and lowest. That shouldn't be too difficult to do, if I could only scrape this table. Any pointers? Ideas? I had to run the httr::GET(config = httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = FALSE)) code bc it kept saying the certificate had expired.

## Question 3: Poverty and homicides. Is there a connection between cities that have high poverty rates and high numbers and rates of homicides? To find this out, we have to first load in income data for each city/

acs5 <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache = TRUE)

below_poverty_level <- get_acs(geography = "place",
                               variables = "B06012_002",
                               cache = TRUE)

below_poverty_level_cleaned <- below_poverty_level %>%
  select(NAME, estimate) %>%
  separate(NAME, into = c("City","State"), sep = ", ")

below_poverty_level_cleaned <- below_poverty_level_cleaned %>%
  select(City, estimate, State) %>%
  mutate(City = str_remove_all(City, " city")) %>%
  mutate(pop_below_poverty_line = estimate) %>%
  mutate(State = state.abb[match(below_poverty_level_cleaned$State, state.name)])

below_poverty_level_cleaned <- below_poverty_level_cleaned %>%
  select(City, State, pop_below_poverty_line)

## Now we have to join the poverty data to the homicide and population data

homicide_poverty <- homicide_data_cleaned %>%
  left_join(below_poverty_level_cleaned, by=c("city"="City", "state"="State"))

## Now we are going to calculate the percent of population in each city that is under 100% of the poverty line

homicide_poverty <- homicide_poverty %>%
  mutate(percent_poverty = (pop_below_poverty_line/population)*100)

## Now lets find the homicide rate for each city and rank which cities have the highest homicide rates (per 100000 people). We should be able to see if there is any coorelation between poverty rate and homicide rate.

homicide_poverty <- homicide_poverty %>%
  select(city, population, percent_poverty) %>%
  group_by(city, population, percent_poverty) %>%
  count()

homicide_poverty <- homicide_poverty %>%
  mutate(homicide_rate = (n/population)*100000)

## Derek, is there a way to calculate the average poverty rate of the bottom 20 or so states in this dataframe when sorted by homicide rate and then calculate the average poverty rate of the top 20? Just eyeballing the dataframe, it looks as though there is a noticeably higher average poverty rate in the states with the highest homicide rates than the ones with the lowest.

#Question 4: Whicb ciy has the highest amount of open cases? 
#first we should filter the data to see just our open cases 
unsolved_homicides <- homicide_data %>%
  filter(disposition=="Open/No arrest") %>%
  select(city, state, disposition)
#now we can find the totals for each city and arrange them spo we can see the city with the highest number of open cases 
unsolved_homicides_clean <- unsolved_homicides %>%
   mutate(city= str_to_title(city)) %>%
    group_by(city) %>%
    summarise(disposition = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(disposition))
#As we can see, Chicago has the most unsolved homicides with 3686. Baltimore is second with 1673 folowed by Detroit with 146.
